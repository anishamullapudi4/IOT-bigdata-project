1. Executive Summary
In stores, there are sales representatives who guide and recommend related products when shopping. On the other hand, many different products are available on online retail platforms, and you have to navigate yourself to find the right one. The situation is that users have too many options and choices available, but don't want to spend a lot of time exploring the entire catalog of items. Therefore, the role of recommender systems (RS) is important for recommending related products and increasing customer conversions and satisfaction.
The project analyzes a dataset of Amazon’s customer reviews from 1995 until 2015 mainly focused on electronics in America. With the help of 2.1 million reviews from various customers we have created a prediction model that provides electronics recommendations to customers, predicts customer reviews based on their real experience using those products as well an ability to find out the most favorable and least rated list of products in a given timeframe. Some of the major challenges that we dealt with were finding the dataset, processing the data, and understanding the data.
The model was then applied to the training dataset, top 10 product recommendations for each consumer, and generation of top 10 user recommendations for each product. Conclusively, the model created using the dataset allowed us to visualize the rating pattern of various users along with predictions of rating, plotting of the negative and positive words from reviews, visualizing the reviews and ratings, generating top recommendations of items for specific users making a unique experience for each user. Our model successfully generates predictive user ratings and recommendations enriching interaction in every step of the way. The aim of this project is to find out business insights, such as: • Analyze customer review and rating behavior • Popularity of products based on reviews • Positive and negative words in reviews • Poorly performing products based on rating
